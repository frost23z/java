# Introduction

## Overview of Java

Java is a widely-used, platform-independent programming language known for its simplicity and power. As an object-oriented language similar to C++ and C#, it offers clear structure and code reusability. Its open-source nature, robust security, and extensive community support have secured its position as a leading programming language in the industry.

## JVM, JRE, JDK

???+ note
    Java bytecode is platform independent, but JVM and JRE are platform dependent, requiring specific implementations for each operating system.

    | Component | Description                  | Contains                                                    |
    |-----------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

    | JRE       | Runs Java applications       | - JVM<br>- Core classes<br>- Supporting files               |
    | JDK       | Complete development package | - JRE<br>- Development tools<br>- Documentation             |

## Run Java Program

???+ info "Compile and Run"
    Compile the Java file using the `javac` command. Ensure the file name matches the public class name. Run the compiled program using the `java` command with the class name (without the `.java` extension).

    ```bash
    javac HelloWorld.java
    java HelloWorld
    ```
    !!! tip "Alternative (Java 11 and later)"
        Ô∏èDirectly compile and run a Java file in one step using the `java` command:

        ```bash
        java HelloWorld.java
        ```
        This eliminates the need for a separate compilation step, making it convenient for quick testing and scripting.

???+ note "Main Method"
    The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program. It must be declared as `public`, `static`, and return `void`. The method signature is:

    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code goes here
    }
    ```
    - The `args` parameter is an array of strings that can be used to pass command-line arguments to the program. It is important to note that the length of this array can vary based on the number of arguments provided during execution. Additionally, if no arguments are provided, the length of the `args` array will be zero.
